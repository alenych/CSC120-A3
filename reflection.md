Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment? 
    I worked with Olivia Kraft
- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend? 
    I attended Professor Jordan's office hours on Tuesday from 11 to 12 pm, during the snow day.
- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
    Java is very different from python, which I am used to, and the syntax was very difficult for me to get. But I was able to get help from many resources and figure out the differences in coding. Additionally, it was initially hard for me to find how functions that I was used to in python work in java.
- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
    Most main functions work in the same way as Python there is just different syntax between the two languages, but the overall idea stays the same. Also, I ran into a coding error when I was saying if "My" or "my" in words: but this was an issue similar to one I would come across in Python where I should have said: if "My in words or "my" in words.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    I struggled initially with the random function and also getting the chatbot to run until a certain condition was met, but attending office hours really helped me fix all of my issues. I would recommend future students to start this assignment extra early and attend as many office hours as they can because they truly helped me.
